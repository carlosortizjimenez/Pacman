<img src= "PacMan1.png" width='300' />

## Project discription
The goal of the project was to begin working with the DOM. The program allows the user to dictate the number of pacmen that will apear and interact with the boundries of the window by bouncing off of them. 
## How to run
The program can be run by selecting either "Start Game" or "Add Pacman" in any order. The speed of the pacmen can be increased by selecting "Start game" while the program is running. Have fun!

## Roadmap of future imporovments
The immediate improvment down the line is to have the Pacmen interact with eachother and have them change color upon impact.
